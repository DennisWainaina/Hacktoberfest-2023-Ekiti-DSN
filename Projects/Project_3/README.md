Build a model with high accuracy in detection of people's moods: 

1. Find a correct dataset to use for people's mood.
2. sketch out a plan that you will use to plot the dataset of people's mood.
3. Create the model of the mood dataset.
4. Use cases and applications to verify that the mood detection works accurately and properly.
